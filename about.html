						<p>It was at my undergraduate institution, the University of California at San Diego, where I decided I would try my hand at the world of science. I graduated with a double major in Biophysics and Japanese in an effort to pursue my passion for science while still appeasing my desire to become fluent in the Japanese language. At the time I was set on going to Japan for graduate school. However, as fate would have it, I put my journey to Japan on hold when I learned I had been accepted into the Biophysics program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2010.</p>

						<p>It was at Illinois where I met the two most influential scientists of my career: (1) Professor Colin Wraight, who accepted me as a graduate student to work with him on the mechanism of electron transfer in bacterial reaction centers, and (2) Dr. Sergei Dikanov, a world expert of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), who shaped me into the EPR spectroscopist I am today. The constant joy and enthusiasm for science that these two exhibited were crucial to the success of my own research and growth as a scientist.</p>

						<p>My chance to conduct research in Japan was to come sooner than I had expected, when I was awarded the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) postdoctoral fellowship. It would not have been possible for me to obtain this fellowship without Colin's letter of recommendation. To my great despair, he passed away before I could tell him the good news.</p>

						<p>In 2014, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan to start a yearlong postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Toshio Iwasaki at the Nippon Medical School. There we worked together on iron-sulfur clusters, utilizing a variety of biophysical techniques such as EPR, X-ray crystallography, and 2D gel electrophoresis. Dr. Iwasaki granted me significant time to study the Japanese language, for which I am grateful to him. I had the opportunity to travel to natural disaster-stricken areas of Japan to teach science, and immerse myself in the Japanese culture (mainly ramen). While I didn't quite manage to pass the highest level Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N1 by the end of my stay in Japan, I managed to pass the second highest JLPT N2. Someday I'd like to challenge JLPT N1 once more!</p>

						<p>In 2016 I secured my current postdoctoral associate position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working under Dr. JoAnne Stubbe and Dr. Robert Griffin. Thus far I've been working on the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an enzyme essential for the conversion of ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides (the building blocks of DNA). Because of my magnetic resonance background, I'm interested in using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for structural studies of the active complex. I'm also interested in using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a complementary technique for solving the protein structure.</p>
