								<li>All cells obtain 2′-deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis through the activity of a ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The class I RNRs found in humans and pathogenic bacteria differ in (i) use of Fe(II), Mn(II), or both for activation of the dinuclear-metallocofactor subunit, β; (ii) reaction of the reduced dimetal center with dioxygen or superoxide for this activation; (iii) requirement (or lack thereof) for a flavoprotein activase, NrdI, to provide the superoxide from O2; and (iv) use of either a stable tyrosyl radical or a high-valent dimetal cluster to initiate each turnover by oxidizing a cysteine residue in the α subunit to a radical (Cys•). The use of manganese by bacterial class I, subclass b-d RNRs, which contrasts with the exclusive use of iron by the eukaryotic Ia enzymes, appears to be a countermeasure of certain pathogens against iron deprivation imposed by their hosts. Here, we report a metal-free type of class I RNR (subclass e) from two human pathogens. The Cys• in its α subunit is generated by a stable, tyrosine-derived dihydroxyphenylalanine radical (DOPA•) in β. The three-electron oxidation producing DOPA• occurs in <i>Escherichia coli</i> only if the β is coexpressed with the NrdI activase encoded adjacently in the pathogen genome. The independence of this new RNR from transition metals, or the requirement for a single metal ion only transiently for activation, may afford the pathogens an even more potent countermeasure against transition metal-directed innate immunity.</li>

								<li>Interpretation of magnetic resonance data in the context of structural and chemical biology requires prior knowledge of the g-tensor directions for paramagnetic metallo-cofactors with respect to the protein structural frame. Access to this information is often limited by the strict requirement of suitable protein crystals for single-crystal electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements or the reliance on protons (with ambiguous locations in crystal structures) near the paramagnetic metal site. Here we develop a novel pulsed EPR approach with selective <sup>13</sup>C<sub>β</sub>-cysteine labeling of model [2Fe-2S] proteins to help bypass these problems. Analysis of the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>β</sub>-cysteine hyperfine tensors reproduces the g-tensor of the Pseudomonas putida ISC-like [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (FdxB). Its application to the hyperthermophilic archaeal Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (ARF) from Sulfolobus solfataricus, for which the single-crystal EPR approach was not feasible, supports the best-fit gx-, gz-, and gy-tensor directions of the reduced cluster as nearly along Fe–Fe, S–S, and the cluster plane normal, respectively. These approximate principal directions of the reduced ARF g-tensor, explored by <sup>13</sup>C pulsed EPR, are less skewed from the cluster molecular axes and are largely consistent with those previously determined by single-crystal EPR for the cytochrome bc<sub>1</sub>-associated, reduced Rieske [2Fe-2S] center. This suggests the approximate g-tensor directions are conserved across the phylogenetically and functionally divergent Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] proteins.</li>

								<li>Hydrogen bonding between semiquinone (SQ) intermediates and side-chain or backbone nitrogens in protein quinone processing sites (Q-sites) is a common motif. Previous studies on SQs from multiple protein environments have reported specific features in the <sup>15</sup>N HYSCORE spectra not reproducible by a theory based on fixed hyperfine parameters, and the source of these lineshape distortions remained unknown. In this work, using the spectra of the SQ in the Q-sites of wild-type and mutant D75H cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli, we have explained the observed additional features as originating from a-strain of the isotropic hyperfine coupling. In two-dimensional spectra, the a-strain manifests as well-resolved lineshape distortions of the basic cross-ridges and accompanying lines of low intensity in the opposite quadrant that allow its direct analysis. We have shown that their appearance is regulated by the relative values of the strain width, Δa, and parameter, δ = |2a + T| – 4ν<sub>15N</sub>. α-strain provides a direct measure of the structural dynamics and heterogeneity of the O···H···N bond in the SQ systems.</li>

								<li>Iron–sulfur clusters are one of the most versatile and ancient classes of redox mediators in biology. The roles that these metal centers take on are predominantly determined by the number and types of coordinating ligands (typically cysteine and histidine) that modify the electronic structure of the cluster. Here we map the spin density distribution onto the cysteine ligands for the three major classes of the protein-bound, reduced [2Fe-2S](His)n(Cys)4–n (n = 0, 1, 2) cluster by selective cysteine-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>β</sub> isotope labeling. The spin distribution is highly asymmetric in all three systems and delocalizes further along the reduced Fe<sup>2+</sup> ligands than the nonreducible Fe<sup>3+</sup> ligands for all clusters studied. The preferential spin transfer onto the chemically reactive Fe<sup>2+</sup> ligands is consistent with the structural concept that the orientation of the cluster in proteins is not arbitrarily decided, but rather is optimized such that it is likely to facilitate better electronic coupling with redox partners. The resolution of all cysteine-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>β</sub> hyperfine couplings and their assignments provides a measure of the relative covalencies of the metal–thiolate bonds not readily available to other techniques.</li>

								<li>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNR) catalyze the reduction of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides through a mechanism involving an essential cysteine based thiyl radical. In the E. coli class 1a RNR the thiyl radical (C439•) is a transient species generated by radical transfer (RT) from a stable diferric-tyrosyl radical cofactor located >35 Å away across the α2:β2 subunit interface. RT is facilitated by sequential proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps along a pathway of redox active amino acids (Y122β ↔ [W48β?] ↔ Y356β ↔ Y731α ↔ Y730α ↔ C439α). The mutant R411A(α) disrupts the H-bonding environment and conformation of Y731, ostensibly breaking the RT pathway in α2. However, the R411A protein retains significant enzymatic activity, suggesting Y731 is conformationally dynamic on the time scale of turnover. Installation of the radical trap 3-amino tyrosine (NH2Y) by amber codon suppression at positions Y731 or Y730 and investigation of the NH2Y• trapped state in the active α2:β2 complex by HYSCORE spectroscopy validate that the perturbed conformation of Y731 in R411A-α2 is dynamic, reforming the H-bond between Y731 and Y730 to allow RT to propagate to Y730. Kinetic studies facilitated by photochemical radical generation reveal that Y731 changes conformation on the ns−μs time scale, significantly faster than the enzymatic kcat. Furthermore, the kinetics of RT across the subunit interface were directly assessed for the first time, demonstrating conformationally dependent RT rates that increase from 0.6 to 1.6 × 104 s<sup>–1</sup> when comparing wild type to R411A-α2, respectively. These results illustrate the role of conformational flexibility in modulating RT kinetics by targeting the PCET pathway of radical transport.</li>

								<li>Determining the complete electron spin density distribution for protein-bound radicals, even with advanced pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods, is a formidable task. Here we present a strategy to overcome this problem combining multifrequency HYSCORE and ENDOR measurements on site-specifically <sup>13C</sup>-labeled samples with DFT calculations on model systems. As a demonstration of this approach, pulsed EPR experiments are performed on the primary Q<sub>A</sub> and secondary Q<sub>B</sub> ubisemiquinones of the photosynthetic reaction center from Rhodobacter sphaeroides <sup>13</sup>C-labeled at the ring and tail positions. Despite the large number of nuclei interacting with the unpaired electron in these samples, two-dimensional X- and Q-band HYSCORE and orientation selective Q-band ENDOR resolve and allow for a characterization of the eight expected <sup>13C</sup> resonances from significantly different hyperfine tensors for both semiquinones. From these results we construct, for the first time, the most complete experimentally determined maps of the s- and p<sub>π</sub>-orbital spin density distributions for any protein organic cofactor radical to date. This work lays a foundation for understanding the relationship between the electronic structure of semiquinones and their functional properties, and introduces new techniques for mapping out the spin density distribution that are readily applicable to other systems.</li>

								<li>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the conversion of nucleoside diphosphate substrates (S) to deoxynucleotides with allosteric effectors (e) controlling their relative ratios and amounts, crucial for fidelity of DNA replication and repair. <i>Escherichia coli</i> class Ia RNR is composed of α and β subunits that form a transient, active α2β2 complex. The <i>E. coli</i> RNR is rate-limited by S/e-dependent conformational change(s) that trigger the radical initiation step through a pathway of 35 Å across the subunit (α/β) interface. The weak subunit affinity and complex nucleotide-dependent quaternary structures have precluded a molecular understanding of the kinetic gating mechanism(s) of the RNR machinery. Using a docking model of α2β2 created from X-ray structures of α and β and conserved residues from a new subclassification of the E. coli Ia RNR (Iag), we identified and investigated four residues at the α/β interface (Glu350 and Glu52 in β2 and Arg329 and Arg639 in α2) of potential interest in kinetic gating. Mutation of each residue resulted in loss of activity and with the exception of E52Q-β2, weakened subunit affinity. An RNR mutant with 2,3,5-trifluorotyrosine radical (F3Y122•) replacing the stable Tyr122• in WT-β2, a mutation that partly overcomes conformational gating, was placed in the E52Q background. Incubation of this double mutant with His6-α2/S/e resulted in an RNR capable of catalyzing pathway-radical formation (Tyr356•-β2), 0.5 eq of dCDP/F3Y122•, and formation of an α2β2 complex that is isolable in pulldown assays over 2 h. Negative stain EM images with S/e (GDP/TTP) revealed the uniformity of the α2β2 complex formed.</li>

								<li>Redox-active tyrosines (Ys) play essential roles in enzymes involved in primary metabolism including energy transduction and deoxynucleotide production catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). Thermodynamic characterization of Ys in solution and in proteins remains a challenge due to the high reduction potentials involved and the reactive nature of the radical state. The structurally characterized α3Y model protein has allowed the first determination of formal reduction potentials (E°′) for a Y residing within a protein (Berry, B. W.; Martı́nez-Rivera, M. C.; Tommos, C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012, 109, 9739–9743). Using Schultz’s technology, a series of fluorotyrosines (FnY, n = 2 or 3) was site-specifically incorporated into α3Y. The global protein properties of the resulting α3(3,5)F2Y, α3(2,3,5)F3Y, α3(2,3)F2Y and α3(2,3,6)F3Y variants are essentially identical to those of α3Y. A protein film square-wave voltammetry approach was developed to successfully obtain reversible voltammograms and E°’s of the very high-potential α3FnY proteins. E°′(pH 5.5; α3FnY(O•/OH)) spans a range of 1040 ± 3 mV to 1200 ± 3 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode. This is comparable to the potentials of the most oxidizing redox cofactors in nature. The FnY analogues, and the ability to site-specifically incorporate them into any protein of interest, provide new tools for mechanistic studies on redox-active Ys in proteins and on functional and aberrant hole-transfer reactions in metallo-enzymes. The former application is illustrated here by using the determined α3FnY ΔE°’s to model the thermodynamics of radical-transfer reactions in FnY-RNRs and to experimentally test and support the key prediction made.</li>

								<li><i>Escherichia coli</i> class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is composed of two subunits that form an active α2β2 complex. The nucleoside diphosphate substrates (NDP) are reduced in α2, 35 Å from the essential diferric-tyrosyl radical (Y122•) cofactor in β2. The Y122•-mediated oxidation of C439 in α2 occurs by a pathway (Y122 ⇆ [W48] ⇆ Y356 in β2 to Y731 ⇆ Y730 ⇆ C439 in α2) across the α/β interface. The absence of an α2β2 structure precludes insight into the location of Y356 and Y731 at the subunit interface. The proximity in the primary sequence of the conserved E350 to Y356 in β2 suggested its importance in catalysis and/or conformational gating. To study its function, pH–rate profiles of wild-type β2/α2 and mutants in which 3,5-difluorotyrosine (F2Y) replaces residue 356, 731, or both are reported in the presence of E350 or E350X (X = A, D, or Q) mutants. With E350, activity is maintained at the pH extremes, suggesting that protonated and deprotonated states of F2Y356 and F2Y731 are active and that radical transport (RT) can occur across the interface by proton-coupled electron transfer at low pH or electron transfer at high pH. With E350X mutants, all RNRs were inactive, suggesting that E350 could be a proton acceptor during oxidation of the interface Ys. To determine if E350 plays a role in conformational gating, the strong oxidants, NO2Y122•-β2 and 2,3,5-F3Y122•-β2, were reacted with α2, CDP, and ATP in E350 and E350X backgrounds and the reactions were monitored for pathway radicals by rapid freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Pathway radicals are generated only when E350 is present, supporting its essential role in gating the conformational change(s) that initiates RT and masking its role as a proton acceptor.</li>

								<li>Chlorophylls are an essential class of cofactors found in all photosynthetic organisms. Upon absorbing a photon, the excited state energy of the chlorophyll can either be transferred to another acceptor molecule, or be used to drive electron transfer. When acting as the primary donor in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center, light-induced charge separation results in the formation of a cationic bacteriochlorophyll dimer. The hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electron of the <sup>15</sup>N labeled bacteriochlorophyll cation radical and its four pyrrole nitrogens are probed with X- and Q-band <sup>15</sup>N HYSCORE spectroscopy in frozen solution. The powder-type HYSCORE shows the basic (<i>ν</i><sub>α(β)</sub>, <i>ν</i><sub>β(α)</sub>) cross-features as well as several types of combination cross-features. The nitrogen tensors were resolved in the squared-frequency representation of the HYSCORE spectra, and simulations of the combination peaks allowed for further refinement of the hyperfine coupling constants. The nitrogen tensors were found to have coupling constants <i>a</i>=3.28 MHz, <i>T</i>=1.23 MHz (N1 and N2), <i>a</i>=4.10 MHz, <i>T</i>=1.25 MHz (N3), and <i>a</i>=4.35 MHz, <i>T</i>=1.70 MHz (N4).

								<li>The respiratory cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub> ubiquinol oxidase from <i>Escherichia coli</i> has a high-affinity ubiquinone binding site that stabilizes the one-electron reduced ubisemiquinone (SQ<sub>H</sub>), which is a transient intermediate during the electron-mediated reduction of O2 to water. It is known that SQ<sub>H</sub> is stabilized by two strong hydrogen bonds from R71 and D75 to ubiquinone carbonyl oxygen O1 and weak hydrogen bonds from H98 and Q101 to O4. In this work, SQ<sub>H</sub> was investigated with orientation-selective Q-band (∼34 GHz) pulsed <sup>1</sup>H electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy on fully deuterated cytochrome (cyt) bo<sub>3</sub> in a H<sub>2</sub>O solvent so that only exchangeable protons contribute to the observed ENDOR spectra. Simulations of the experimental ENDOR spectra provided the principal values and directions of the hyperfine (hfi) tensors for the two strongly coupled H-bond protons (H1 and H2). For H1, the largest principal component of the proton anisotropic hfi tensor T<sub>z′</sub> = 11.8 MHz, whereas for H2, T<sub>z′</sub> = 8.6 MHz. Remarkably, the data show that the direction of the H1 H-bond is nearly perpendicular to the quinone plane (∼70° out of plane). The orientation of the second strong hydrogen bond, H2, is out of plane by ∼25°. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on a membrane-embedded model of the cyt bo<sub>3</sub> Q<sub>H</sub> site show that these H-bond orientations are plausible but do not distinguish which H-bond, from R71 or D75, is nearly perpendicular to the quinone ring. Density functional theory calculations support the idea that the distances and geometries of the H-bonds to the ubiquinone carbonyl oxygens, along with the measured proton anisotropic hfi couplings, are most compatible with an anionic (deprotonated) ubisemiquinone.</li>

								<li>Unlike photosystem II (PSII) in higher plants, bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers (bRCs) from Proteobacteria have an additional peripheral membrane subunit “H”. The H subunit is necessary for photosynthetic growth, but can be removed chemically in vitro. The remaining LM dimer retains its activity to perform light-induced charge separation. Here we investigate the influence of the H subunit on interactions between the primary semiquinone and the protein matrix, using a combination of site-specific isotope labeling, pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The data reveal substantially weaker binding interactions between the primary semiquinone and the LM dimer than observed for the intact bRC; the amount of electron spin transferred to the nitrogen hydrogen bond donors is significantly reduced, the methoxy groups are more free to rotate, and the spectra indicate a heterogeneous mixture of bound semiquinone states. These results are consistent with a loosening of the primary quinone binding pocket in the absence of the H subunit.</li><img alt="Regulation of the Primary Quinone Binding Conformation" title="Regulation of the Primary Quinone Binding Conformation" src="http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpclcd/2015/jpclcd.2015.6.issue-22/acs.jpclett.5b01851/20151224/images/medium/jz-2015-01851b_0007.gif">

								<li>Cytochrome <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub>-600 is a terminal oxidase in the electron transport pathway that contributes to the electrochemical membrane potential by actively pumping protons. A notable feature of this enzyme complex is that it uses menaquinol as its electron donor instead of cytochrome c when it reduces dioxygen to water. The enzyme stabilizes a menasemiquinone radical (SQ) at a high affinity site that is important for catalysis. One of the residues that interacts with the semiquinone is Arg70. We have made the R70H mutant and have characterized the menasemiquinone radical by advanced X- and Q-band EPR. The bound SQ of the R70H mutant exhibits a strong isotropic hyperfine coupling (<i>a</i><sup>14</sup>N ≈ 2.0 MHz) with a hydrogen bonded nitrogen. This nitrogen originates from a histidine side chain, based on its quadrupole coupling constant, e<sup>2</sup>qQ/h = 1.44 MHz, typical for protonated imidazole nitrogens. In the wild-type cyt <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub>-600, the SQ is instead hydrogen bonded with Nε from the Arg70 side chain. Analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H 2D electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectra shows that the mutation also changes the number and strength of the hydrogen bonds between the SQ and the surrounding protein. Despite the alterations in the immediate environment of the SQ, the R70H mutant remains catalytically active. These findings are in contrast to the equivalent mutation in the close homologue, cytochrome <i>bo</i><sub>3</sub> ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli, where the R71H mutation eliminates function.</li><img alt="Plasticity in the High Affinity Menaquinone Binding Site of the Cytochrome" title="Plasticity in the High Affinity Menaquinone Binding Site of the Cytochrome" src="http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/2015/bichaw.2015.54.issue-32/acs.biochem.5b00528/20150822/images/medium/bi-2015-005284_0005.gif">

								<li>By utilizing a combined pulsed EPR and DFT approach, the high-resolution structure of the Q<sub>B</sub> site semiquinone (SQ<sub>B</sub>) was determined. The development of such a technique is crucial toward an understanding of protein-bound semiquinones on the structural level, as (i) membrane protein crystallography typically results in low resolution structures, and (ii) obtaining protein crystals in the semiquinone form is rarely feasible. The SQ<sub>B</sub> hydrogen bond network was investigated with Q- (∼34 GHz) and X-band (∼9.7 GHz) pulsed EPR spectroscopy on fully deuterated reactions centers from <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i>. Simulations in the SQ<sub>B</sub> g-tensor reference frame provided the principal values and directions of the H-bond proton hyperfine tensors. Three protons were detected, one with an anisotropic tensor component, <i>T</i> = 4.6 MHz, assigned to the histidine NδH of His-L190, and two others with similar anisotropic constants <i>T</i> = 3.2 and 3.0 MHz assigned to the peptide NpH of Gly-L225 and Ile-L224, respectively. Despite the strong similarity in the peptide couplings, all hyperfine tensors were resolved in the Q-band ENDOR spectra. The Euler angles describing the series of rotations that bring the hyperfine tensors into the SQ<sub>B</sub> g-tensor reference frame were obtained by least-squares fitting of the spectral simulations to the ENDOR data. These Euler angles show the locations of the hydrogen bonded protons with respect to the semiquinone.

								<li>Ubiquinone forms an integral part of the electron transport chain in cellular respiration and photosynthesis across a vast number of organisms. Prior experimental results have shown that the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> is only fully functional with a limited set of methoxy-bearing quinones, suggesting that specific interactions with this substituent are required to drive electron transport and the formation of quinol. The nature of these interactions has yet to be determined. Through parameterization of a CHARMM-compatible quinone force field and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of the quinone-bound RC, we have investigated and characterized the interactions of the protein with the quinones in the Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> sites using both equilibrium simulation and thermodynamic integration. In particular, we identify a specific interaction between the 2-methoxy group of ubiquinone in the Q<sub>B</sub> site and the amide nitrogen of GlyL225 that we implicate in locking the orientation of the 2-methoxy group, thereby tuning the redox potential difference between the quinones occupying the Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> sites. Disruption of this interaction leads to weaker binding in a ubiquinone analogue that lacks a 2-methoxy group, a finding supported by reverse electron transfer electron paramagnetic resonance experiments of the Q<sub>A</sub><sup>–</sup>Q<sub>B</sub><sup>–</sup> biradical and competitive binding assays.</li><img alt="Redox Potential Tuning through Differential Quinone Binding" title="Redox Potential Tuning through Differential Quinone Binding" src="http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/2015/bichaw.2015.54.issue-12/acs.biochem.5b00033/20150325/images/medium/bi-2015-00033d_0012.gif">

Simulations resolve this apparent discrepancy by showing that the shift of the sum combination to lower frequency and its broadening can be accounted for by a distribution of the hyperfine couplings.

								<li>Ubiquinone is an almost universal, membrane-associated redox mediator. Its ability to accept either one or two electrons allows it to function in critical roles in biological electron transport. The redox properties of ubiquinone in vivo are determined by its environment in the binding sites of proteins and by the dihedral angle of each methoxy group relative to the ring plane. This is an attribute unique to ubiquinone among natural quinones and could account for its widespread function with many different redox complexes. In this work, we use the photosynthetic reaction center as a model system for understanding the role of methoxy conformations in determining the redox potential of the ubiquinone/semiquinone couple. Despite the abundance of X-ray crystal structures for the reaction center, quinone site resolution has thus far been too low to provide a reliable measure of the methoxy dihedral angles of the primary and secondary quinones, Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub>. We performed 2D ESEEM (HYSCORE) on isolated reaction centers with ubiquinones <sup>13</sup>C-labeled at the headgroup methyl and methoxy substituents, and have measured the <sup>13</sup>C isotropic and anisotropic components of the hyperfine tensors. Hyperfine couplings were compared to those derived by DFT calculations as a function of methoxy torsional angle allowing estimation of the methoxy dihedral angles for the semiquinones in the Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> sites. Based on this analysis, the orientation of the 2-methoxy groups are distinct in the two sites, with Q<sub>B</sub> more out of plane by 20–25°. This corresponds to an ≈50 meV larger electron affinity for the Q<sub>B</sub> quinone, indicating a substantial contribution to the experimental difference in redox potentials (60–75 mV) of the two quinones. The methods developed here can be readily extended to ubiquinone-binding sites in other protein complexes.</li><img alt="Conformational Differences between the Methoxy Groups" title="Conformational Differences between the Methoxy Groups" src="http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/2013/bichaw.2013.52.issue-27/bi400489b/production/images/medium/bi-2013-00489b_0005.gif">
